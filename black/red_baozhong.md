## Vendor description 

You may refer to this tea as a black tea if you prefer but we wished to use the direct translation of Hong Cha, literally red tea, as all black teas are called in mandarin. We also wanted to keep the reference to Bao Zhong, which is the defining style of tea made in the surrounding hills near Taipei. We did so to emphasize the fact that its production process is more akin to the very popular low-oxidized fragrant tea, but this time definitely more oxidized. This also emphasizes the fact that the maker is staying true to his craft and know-how and not trying to copy what is made in other regions famous for their black tea. The result is an original tea which is rooted in the authenticity of its terroir. Mr. Ong, our long time collaborator for Bao Zhong Tea, has crafted a unique tea that is as charming as his fragrant green oolongs. It is lively and refreshing and flows delightfully without a hint of brashness. The nose and attack reminds us of sweet violets and stone fruits with a delicate cane sugar foundation. It is smooth and silky with a long fresh aftertaste, much like high-mountain black teas. This is a tea that will attract not only black tea enthusiasts because of its distinctive character but also fragrant oolong fans for its accessibility, especially the ones that don’t usually fancy black teas! As with all Bao Zhong Teas, this is sunshine in a cup that comes at a time when many of us are in need of extra warmth for the soul, mind and body.
