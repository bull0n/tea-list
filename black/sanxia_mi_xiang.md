## Vendor description 

Mostly known today for its green teas, the hills of Sanxia District, south of Taipei, was also famous for its smoked black tea popularized as Formosa Tarry Souchong in the west many years ago. The practice of smoking tea has now disappeared due to environmental considerations but black tea making remained and was further refined to higher quality grades as the export trade of commodity black tea tapered off. This Lot 944 is a good example of a Premium Grade from this area, made from a fine picking of smaller Qing Xin Gan Zhi leaves with plenty of buds in April. This particular lot was also graced by the distinctive and sought after Mi Xiang character that proposes a defined honey aroma and smoothness in the taste. Made by the same multi-generation family of tea makers that is responsible for our Bi Luo Chun and Long Jing Green teas as well as our Sanxia White tea, this superb black tea is generously lush with ripe exotic fruit notes (mango, white peach), sweet and refreshing. Like all small-leaf black teas, its tannic structure is smooth and silky with very low acidity making it a very refreshing choice for the hot summer months. This Lot 944 is a limited seasonal offering available while it lasts. If you like high mountain black teas, or any other Taiwanese small-leaf black tea, this is a must-try!
