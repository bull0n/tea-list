#### Description / comment

Approaching the end of the package, very clean taste and fresh, smell of the leafs in the wet gaiwan before hot water is really mouth-watering. But didn0t manage to reproduce that smell in the taste.

Also tried lower temperature with longer time. It works well but the taste is slightly different, neither worse or better.

When overbrewed the tea liquor get much less translucide.
