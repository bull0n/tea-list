## Vendor description 

Seogwang Woojeon First Flush is a Korean green tea of the highest class. It is harvested before the monsoon and therefore has very fine leaves. Woojeon translated means "before the rain" indicating the time of harvest before the monsoon.  An other common name is sparrows tongue. This name derives from the tea leaves appearance reminiscent of tiny sparrow tongues.
 
Woojeon is a insider tip among tea connoisseurs and is due to it's taste most associated with Gyokuro but also because of the look and toasty notes with Tamaryokucha. It tastes fresh and slightly fruity and surprised with an intense umami flavor. This is achieved by combining special flavor of Chinese and Japanese art of tea: The tea is shaded before harvest, steamed and then roasted in addition. This extraordinary tea doesn't get bitter even if steepde too long and is therefor also suitable for beginners.
 
The tea garden of Seogwang Farm is located on the Korean island of Jeju. It's located in the triangle Korea - China - Japan and is of volcanic origin. Through the 1950m high volcano Halla, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, clouds accumulate and therefore it rains often and is foggy. Combined with mild temperatures and mineral rich soils, these are ideal conditions for the cultivation of high-quality tea. The tea farm Seogwang grows purely organic and is certified according to EU organic standards. Unfortunately, we ourselves are not yet certified and this tea may therefore not be advertised with the label "organic".
