## Vendor description 

This spring 2020 comes from a new grower in an area of Alishan called Da Jian Shan. We’ve been courting this grower since last spring and were looking forward to selecting our first Lot from the highest section of his Jin Xuan section this year.  It has the typical green, crisp pastoral notes with hints of mountain flowers that charms the nose. The palate will immediately be pleased by the ample milky texture and taste that evokes fresh buttered green vegetables with hints of sweetness. All in all, it is a very satisfying cup that bears the characteristic generous qualities of high mountain teas at a very affordable price. This is a good benchmark tea to be introduced to high-mountain Jin Xuan teas. The name Jin Xuan refers to a specific tea varietal developed by the Taiwan Research and Experiment Station (TRES) dedicated to the improvement of the tea industry of Taiwan. Jin Xuan teas are satisfying teas to drink as they offer good amplitude in texture and taste. With mild floral notes, they have the greatest potential for sweetness with hints of exotic fruit. Teas elaborated with Jin Xuan leaves has a particularly creamy texture with a distinctive milky smoothness and sweetness. Our Alishan Jin Xuan is a very good example of how this strand has contributed to the characteristic high mountain oolong taste.
