## Vendor description 

Lot 875 is from the same producer that we’ve been working with in the past years which consistently produces stellar teas that sell-out very quickly. We expect it will be the same this winter 2019 since the quality of his production is very high and consistent in delivering expressive, yet balanced teas from season to season. This winter’s offering is typical in the thick mellow texture one expects from a good winter tea. Our guideline is always to find growers/producers that are worthy representatives of the defining character of their terroir as well as having a harmonious relationship with the land and traditions of their craft. It is clearly the case here as the cup will reveal heady floral notes that hint towards Orchids; a thick satisfying body with a rapturous layered flavour palette and a smooth finish. The balsam notes are there, the sweet pastoral aroma of alpine wild summer flowers and sun-dried grain will charm all of your senses. This is a by far a superior Alishan that highlights the easy-drinking character of this terroir’s teas and a very good introductory tea to high-mountain oolongs. Highly recommended!

a bit disappointing, flavor doesn't last long, maybe water too hard?
