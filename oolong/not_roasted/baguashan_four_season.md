## Vendor description 

Patience is a virtue when you seek the best. When it comes to our long-standing friendship with Mr. Yi, we are now entitled to our reserved section of one of his own tea gardens for our needs. We prefer to wait a little longer to catch the production made from his own garden-grown leaves instead of the ones he purchases from other growers because, not only does he craft the best Four Seasons Oolong, he also grows the best leaves. The exuberant expressive bouquet of liquid flowers like none other than our good friend Mr. Yi can make is definitely present in this Spring 2020 Lot but it also offers more amplitude in the body and texture with its slightly more oxidized process than previous iterations. Mr. Yi’s family, like ours, has been sowing the red earth of our community and rolling little green pearls of delight for generations now. Mr. Yi is one of the rare grower/producer in our community that is never content in making a commodity grade tea – which is the unfortunate reputation this type of tea has in Taiwan. He produces his Four Seasons with the same care and dedication as he would with a high-priced high-mountain oolong. It shows in each cup you will sip! The lively character of this semi-wild strand simply tastes like happiness in a liquid form! This is a surprisingly expressive tea, very aromatic, with distinct fresh spring notes that evokes lilies of the valley and jasmine. It is very refreshing and fun to drink. Some people say it is very much like Chinese Anxi Tie Guan Yin. Most of the four season oolong tea is grown right here in our own Township of Mingjian in Nantou County, Taiwan. This area, at an elevation of up to 400 m above sea level, has the largest concentration of tea growers on this island and produces the largest quantity of tea in Taiwan.
