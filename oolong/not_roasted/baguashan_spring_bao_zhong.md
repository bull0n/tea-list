## Vendor description 

Our Baguashan Bao Zhong (or Pouchong as it is also known in the western world) is made according to the traditional methods that have made the reputation of the Wen Shan area of northern Taiwan. It is a tea that can highlight the skill and craftsmanship of its maker, or do the exact opposite if it is poorly made. The lightly rolled, lightly oxidized full leaves of the dried tea are simply beautiful to look at. When steeped, the leaves unfurl rapidly to reveal their intriguing aroma of green vegetal notes that evokes buttered green beans with distinctive floral overtones. Nothing aggresses the senses. The liqueur is smooth, creamy, and very pleasant. This tea is the second Lot we specially commissioned for us this spring and made by Mr. Li, a neighbour of ours. The first was “primeur” lot made on the first day of Spring last March that sold out in exactly one month! This second production is just as good with a bit more body. This tea is made from leaves that we’ve witnessed growing daily a few hundred metres away from us. The maker’s expert drying technique lightly bakes the leaves which helps seal the flavours and aroma in, and adds a very pleasant almond-like finish and taste. Drinking fresh Bao Zhong is like drinking sunshine in a cup! This spring 2020 crop is just that; tangy, fragrant and lively, this is definitively an uplifting experience.
