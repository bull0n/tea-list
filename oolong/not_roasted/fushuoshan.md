## Vendor description 

The magic of the Dragon’s Gorge (Longfengxia) has once again revealed itself in an exquisite spring 2020 production. Our appeal for this micro-terroir of the greater Shanlinxi one is not a secret anymore. As customary, our privileged relationship with the Chen’s allowed us to taste every single production day’s output and cherry pick the second day’s one. This is our usual choice as the leaves come from the first picking of the highest section of the garden, and, the tea maker had a chance to calibrate his technique with day 1. The marvellous yellow-gold colour of this season’s Longfengxia already announces that we are in for a treat! Then, the wild and flowery aroma enthrals you to take a sip and experience a full bodied, thick yet smooth liqueur where crisp balsamic notes with a hint of sweetness linger on and on. This tea is very generous, in the cup and in the number of infusions one can extract from these beautifully crafted leaves. Teas from this terroir are a delight, and the teas that originate from this particular garden are exemplary. The numerous followers they have amongst you is the best testimony to the skill of this 2 generation family operation. Longfengxia designates the area in the higher levels of the Shanlinxi terroir of Nantou County. It is very often referred to for its spectacular scenery where the tea gardens cling to the mountain on near vertical vertiginous slopes. Shanlinxi oolong distinguishes itself from other Gao Shan oolongs in that it features clearly defined balsam notes that make it particularly appealing to the palate and nose. It is a must for all high mountain enthusiasts and we must warn you… it is very addictive!
