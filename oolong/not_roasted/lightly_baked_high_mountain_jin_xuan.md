## Vendor description 

The name Jin Xuan refers to a specific tea varietal developed by the Taiwan Research and Experiment Station which is the national research centre dedicated to the improvement of the tea industry of Taiwan. You can read more about it in the tab below. Jin Xuan teas are satisfying teas to drink as they offer good amplitude in texture and taste. With mild floral notes, they have the greatest potential for sweetness with hints of exotic fruit. Teas elaborated with Jin Xuan leaves has a particularly creamy texture with a distinctive milky smoothness and sweetness. This velvety sweet character is best brought out through a controled slow baking process. This is where our Tea Maker’s skill is challenged the most since the aim is to bring out the sweetness while still keeping the flowery aroma and pastoral notes. High-Mountain teas are the preferred choice for their higher concentration in aromatic material. They deliver expressiveness and a rich texture. Our team was involved at all steps in the tea making process of this tea with a particular attention to the final baking stage. This is another tea that can be put under the umbrella of the Lane 503 Project. We are particularly excited at the extraordinary potential that lies ahead when 2 multi-generational tea families put their resources and talent together to re-think how tea should be grown, made and marketed in the 21st century. What is particularly exciting is the fact that it is the younger generation that is driving this project. Be in the loop! Leave us your comments below if you ever grace us by trying one of the project’s first teas.
