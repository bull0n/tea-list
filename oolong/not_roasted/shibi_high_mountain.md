## Vendor description 

Excitement always prevails when it’s time to visit this magnificent garden during our spring-time rounds as it has become our benchmark garden to rate the quality of a season. The craftsmanship and care both in the garden and in the factory from the people behind this tea are exemplary and well-recognized amongst local tea makers. Therefore, if the tea is good or superb relies on the uncontrollable nature-born factors like the prevailing weather since last winter. This spring 2020, we were also excited in anticipation to taste a custom production made just for us with a slightly higher oxidation which we can designated as a traditional oxidation level. This results in a thicker, more buttery texture with sweeter floral notes and a less grassy attack. Fans of this tea will still be in recognizable territory but will benefit from a fuller mouth-feel, yet smooth and sophisticated and very well balanced between the floral notes, the crisp pastoral ones and the clean mellow finish. As with all previous lots from this garden, the adjective “clean” also comes from the fact that this garden is certified to meet the EU norm for low pesticide use: one of the most stringent norm of the kind right now. Another good reason to indulge! This spring 2020 peaks with succulent notes of spring flowers and smooth vegetal nuances that culminate with a silky smooth finish. This spring’s is thick and generous in well-balanced organoleptic material that are sure to give many satisfying infusions of joy in the cup. This is our “go to” tea when we are wanting to enjoy a good high-mountain tea.
