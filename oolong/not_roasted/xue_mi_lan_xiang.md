## Vendor description 

This exceptional Dan Cong is called Xue Mi Lan Xiang. It  translates honey-orchid fragrance and describes the character of the tea. Xue Mi Lan Xiang Dan Cong is harvested in winter during a warm period when the tea plant starts budding. The tea is characterized by its particularly honey-like sweetness which is underlaid with a subtle fragrance of orchid. This type of oolong is also called Phoenix Dan Cong and can be infused several times.

Dan Cong Oolong is grown on the slopes of the Pheonix mountains around the city Fenghuang together with other crops and is partly wild. Through this high biodiversity are pest naturaly controlled and the use of pesticides is unnecessary. The Phoenix Mountain range extends between a height of 300 and up to 1500m. The climate with an average temperature of 22°C is considered mild.

Tea production in Chaozhou has a tradition of over a thousand year and the historical knowledge of the art of tea is passed on from generation to generation. This special type of tea is grown by a small family business in Fenghuang and thanks to centuries-old knowledge is processed into a top class Oolong. The whole family is involved in the harvest and the entire tea production. It is still produced in the traditional way as in the times of Lu Yu: the tea is dried and wilted in bamboo trays and then roasted over charcoal fire. The most important work step, the withering, is still done manually by our producers. This is of course very time-consuming but has the advantage that you have maximum control over the withering process. The results speak for themselves! In our blog post you can see how Tea Master Song processes the tea leaves and at the same time passes on his knowledge to a student.
