## Vendor description 

Take a heritage strand brought to Taiwan from the hills of Fujian more than a century ago which has evolved to be one of defining style of tea from the surrounding hills of Taipei. Bring along the near-secretive craft of deeper oxidation and firing of these leaves into multi-layered, generously complex teas that has made Muzha famous and transpose all of this further south in central Taiwan; inside our own workshop/house, to be specific, and this is the story that is sealed into these nut-brown pearls of tea. Tie Guan Yin bushes were planted in one of our relative’s garden in the world-famous Alishan tea district (see pictures), where the leaves were produced into tea according to the northern tradition. As with our previous iterations, Yuwen was compelled to spend many nights overseeing the several rounds of baking sessions over several weeks in March, right before the start of the spring tea season. This iteration follows in the foot steps of the previous Lots 831, 716, 627 and 478 but with the added baking tweaks learnt from the previous lots. This Lot 905 rests on the experience gained in winning a First Place Ranking in the Spring 2019 LGTTS Dong Ding Competition and has everything one must expect from a good traditional Tie Guan Yin: a smooth, layered complexity that challenges the palate but never aggresses it. The dried fruits are there, the roasted nuts, the caramelized sweetness and the spiciness. Everything is there in a perfect harmonious balance. This tea has body and persistence. This is often the sign of a well fired tea showing the skill of its maker. This tea is already good, it will become a stellar one if allowed to age, if you can resist not drinking it now…  We still can’t tire from it. it has become one of our staple teas for evening seances.
