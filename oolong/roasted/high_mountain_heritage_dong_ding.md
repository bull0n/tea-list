## Vendor description 

With Lot 834, we continue the tradition of sourcing the best spring tea, allowing it to mellow and baking it to perfection at the end of the year. No wonder this has become one of our flagship teas. With Yuwen’s recent First Place Award at the Spring 2019 LGTTS Dong Ding Tea Competition in Lugu under her belt, you have the added assurance of drinking a true championship-style tea! Just as the previous years, we commissioned the same reputable tea producer to make an exclusive lot for us of higher-oxidized high mountain oolong, as the tradition requires. We only commission spring or winter productions of this tea as they tend to offer more aromatic material in the leaf and a better tannic balance. After a mellowing rest of a full 6 months, the baking craftsmanship of our tea master was put in motion in late October. The tea has been given a 3 step slow baking process to better highlight its smooth deep character and generous texture. A quick rinsing of the leaves will wake the wonderful roasted aromas which are both inquisitive and familiar with distinct caramel sweetness but a closer introspection will reveal intricate layers of more pungeant floral and wood aromas. A first infusion will reveal a deep nut brown liqueur which signals that we are in the presence of a deeper level of roasting. The liqueur is thick and multi-layered in mellow bitter-sweet, nutty and spicy feeling that lingers long after swallowing. The liqueur has a good body and a nice thickness and is full of flavour and the floral intricacy of wild honey. Extremely generous in re-steepings! We will humbly state that this tea holds a lot of promise if allowed to mellow and age. This Lot 834 follows in the footsteps of our previous lots with great pride! Indulge!
