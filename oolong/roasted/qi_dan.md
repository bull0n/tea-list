## Vendor description 

DESCRIPTION: In the early 1980s, the asexual propagation of Dahongpao was successful; in 1995, experts from Fujian Provincial Science and Technology Commission identified that Dahongpao, which had asexual propagation, maintained the excellent characteristics of its mother, and could be widely popularized in the specific ecological environment of Northern Fujian. So this asexual Dahongpao is Qi Dan ,Yan Cha Qi Dan of Wuyi Mountain is primitive and ancient with high moral character. Although it has a strong fragrance, it does not attract people to drink tea with its fragrance, nor does it attract people's eyes with its gorgeous appearance. It hides the true flavor in its heart. Its forbearing and introverted temperament is just like a man of practice, holding the heaven and the earth in his heart - sitting on the clouds, watching the clouds, and laughing at the ups and downs.

CHARACTERISTICS: The shape of the dried tea is plump and even, slightly curved, with a dark brown color. Sweet fragrance, honey fragrance, flower, and fruit fragrance and other unique fragrance must not be missed before tea making. Its tea soup is deep orange and red, with strong sweet osmanthus and sweet potato fragrance. It tastes mellow, sweet and quiet, and has obvious rock rhyme. After drinking, it leaves a fragrance on the teeth and cheeks. Qi Dan's taste is fragrant, clear and mellow. It can still keep the fresh and mellow after five or six bubbles. Sweet back soft, fast, alive and sweet to maintain three or four hours. The bitterness of the first taste and the acid rot of the second taste will be known after three cups. Sweet and mellow for a long time, to cure physical and mental illness and pain. If tea is like life, the magic pill of Wuyishan can give a full play to the taste of life, bitterness, sour and sweet!

Let's calm down and admire the first product of Qidan!
