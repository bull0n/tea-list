## Vendor description

DESCRIPTION: In July 2019, I took Yan, a good friend of Poland, to visit my Uncle Wu's tea garden. Today, I share with you my Uncle Wu's Shui Xian. The place of origin is Wu San Di. What kind of village is Wu San Di? In the spring of 1681, Wu San GUI's report of pacification and rebellion in Yunnan Province heralded the real coming of the Great Qing Dynasty. The three brothers of Wu family fled and came to this valley. This place is located under the roof of Huanggang mountain, with an average altitude of 800 meters, which is very suitable for reclusion. After a simple discussion, the three brothers decided to stay here. At that time, the three brothers of Wu family had no economic source, so they had to live in the valley They planted pure Shui Xian tea trees to live on. This kind of tea closely linked the warmth of more than 300 years with the descendants of Wu family. Later descendants all took the surname Wu, which is why people in Uncle Wu village are surnamed Wu. Wu San Di is the best-preserved pure land in Wuyi Mountain, with high altitude and ecological environment. Tea garden sea It's more than 800 meters long, surrounded by mountains, with rich vegetation, dense streams at the foot of the mountain, surrounded by clouds all year-round, and due to the lack of sunshine and many other factors, the quality of tea is very good.

CHARACTERISTICS: Today's Wu San Di's Shui Xian is picked in spring 2018, roasted once in June, roasted once in November, roasted once in May 2019, and now, this Shui Xian's tea has preserved the soup has the taste of green moss and the flavor of mountains. The entrance is very sweet and lasting. In order to let you experience the taste of Wu San Di Shui Xian, I decided to use 15kg to do this activity.
