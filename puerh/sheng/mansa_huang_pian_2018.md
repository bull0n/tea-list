## Vendor description 

For this Zhuancha we used Huang Pian from our popular Mansa Gushu 2018. The tea trees in Mansa are partly shaded and partly at the blazing sun. This special condition results in a particularly balanced aroma. The shaded tea leaves are particularly flowery in the aroma, while the sun-kissed tea leaves provide a strong Cha Qi.

Huang Pian material like this consists of the larger and older yellow leaves which are sorted out during the Pu-Erh during processing. The result is often a tea that is softer and sweeter and also mor economic than the original.

This tea was stored in Xishuangbanna for two years and is therefore quiet ripe for its age.
