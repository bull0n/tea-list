## Vendor description 

An excellent and affordable cooked PuErh made from very young leaves and buds making it a Royal grade ripe tea. This PuErh has been ripened really well with no unwanted molds developing. The taste is clean without any of the fishy aromas of poorly made or badly stored ripened tea.

Clearly ageing does not have the same transformative effect on ripe as it does on raw PuErh but storing the tea for a few years really allows the mustiness caused by the ripening process to dissipate. This Fire Phoenix has been stored since 2008 making it ultra clean tasting and smoother than the freshly made ripe PuErh.

It makes an excellent digestif after a heavy meal with its cleansing and cooling richness and minerality. The perfect go-to ripe PuErh for everyday drinking.
