## Vendor description 

Blended to favor the dense flavors of petrichor and wood, this style of ripe Puer is focused on unfolding as an experience with notes of camphor and lower umber toned tastes. Will benefit from further aging, but if youâ€™re down for what this tea is offering, we suspect you can drink it straight away without flinching.

Each purchase is for one ~ 7 gram ball.
Lumber balls was pressed in 2019. Roughly 7g of tea per ball.
