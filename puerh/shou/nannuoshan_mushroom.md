## Vendor description 


This is a really delightful shou puerh that we fell in love with this year. The material is a blend of multiple years of shou puerh material from Nannuo Shan. Some of the material is as old as 20 years. This is a very unique shou puerh. It has a flavor and aroma profile we've not seen before. There is a delightful nutty herbal note in the aroma.

Each mini mushroom is about 4 grams. Don't let their small size fool you. These brew fast and intense. There is a lot of tea in these little ones. When we fill a bag we measure by weight in grams. There may be more or less actual mini mushrooms depending on their size and weight. You will get at least 50g of tea in each bag.

    "…The Nannuo mini mushroom tastes creamy like real vanilla beans. I first worried my teaware was contaminated, as the vanilla flavor was quite profound. The background is earthy, woodsy sweet, with a bit of an abrasive throat feel after each sip. … You know a shou is good when it is inky black – and this colour is crazy as I am using less tea than usual. The flavor is creamy smooth and lightly earthy. The main flavor is a light vanilla sweetness. … It is a cold Autumn day, so the shou is making me feel nicely warm. The aftertaste is subtle with a bit of creamy, but after some time it leaves a clean feeling in the mouth."
