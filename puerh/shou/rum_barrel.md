## Vendor description 

Rum Barrel is back! This always sells out quickly. This tasty concoction is part of the ongoing research from the Crimson Lotus Tea Puerh Research Laboratories (CLTPRL) . We have very limited quantities of this material. 

This delicious, dark brewing, imperial grade shou puerh tea was allowed to age in a wooden rum barrel that held dark rum. This time we aged it for an ENTIRE year. This special tea is an aromatic delight with aromas ranging from banana bread to tiramisu. 

These feature custom Jianshui clay storage jars we had made. Each jar holds 60g of loose "Rum Barrel" shou puerh tea. 

For this batch we are making 15 "recharge packs" available for those of you who already have jars and need more tea. They will come sealed in a foil bag.

Storing tea in these jars is advantageous to most other methods. The jars provide a micro climate that is resilient to humidity shifts. You can continue to store tea in these jars for many years. When you drink up all the rum puerh toss in some more leaf.

We packed these jars with shou puerh fresh from the rum barrel and sealed them up tight. They should be super aromatic when they arrive.

The jars are polished black. Since these are handmade products each are unique. There are slight variations to each. Yours will vary slightly from the pictures. They may be a little bit taller or wider than measured. These jars measure on average 8cm total width and around 9cm tall.

This material is not being pressed and will only be sold here. We apologize but our current COVID-19 discounts don't apply to this tea.
