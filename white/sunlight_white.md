## Vendor description 

The 2017 white tea is made in a natural white style. The tea has minimal processing, picked and sun dried. This tea was processed from tea that is usually destined for raw Puer from the Mengsong mountain range in Yunnan.

The Sunlight White is sweet and soft, with a full range of leaves contributing to its depth. It is wispy and easy to drink with a natural character and a light floral fragrance. Perfect to drink now, but could be aged as well.

Each purchase is for 50 grams.
